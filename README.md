# Actfound_demo

## Colab programmatic tool
‚≠ê We have now added a ready-to-use online programmatic tool on Colab.

üòä You can easily use Colab tools to fine-tune Actfound with few measured compounds and then use it to give prediction on your unmeasured compounds.

‚ù§Ô∏è We also provide a metric in this colab to help you predict if Actfound can works well on your data with only few measured compounds for fine-tuning. (See Figure 3.g.h of our paper for more detailes)

- Colab for finetuning full parameters of Actfound (can be more suitable when you have many measured compounds for finetuning, e.g. more than 300)
